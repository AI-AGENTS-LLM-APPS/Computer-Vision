Hand Gesture Volume Control, AI Trainer, Finger Counter, Face Mesh & Face Detection
This is a basic computer vision project where I used MediaPipe and OpenCV to create:

Volume Hand Changer: Control your systemâ€™s volume using hand gestures by measuring the distance between fingers.

AI Trainer: A simple trainer that uses pose or hand tracking to guide movements.

Finger Counter: Counts how many fingers are up using real-time hand landmarks.

Face Mesh: Detects facial landmarks and overlays a mesh on the face in real time.

Face Detection: Detects faces in the webcam feed.

Tools Used: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe
Purpose: Practiced real-time hand tracking, gesture control, face mesh generation, and face detection.
